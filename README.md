The course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for FREE from one of India’s top educators in DSA.


This course is made for people who want to learn DSA from A to Z for free in a well-organized and structured manner. The lecture quality is better than what you get in paid courses, the only thing we don’t provide is doubt support, but trust me our YouTube video comments resolve that as well, we have a wonderful community of 250K+ people who engage in all of the videos.

There might be a lot of existing courses/sheets in the market, but this is better in terms of structure, and the number of questions we will be doing. We just don’t teach the basics, we cover all the varieties, and we go in super depth for each topic, so that you are well prepared for any of your interviews.
